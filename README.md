# MachineLearningC++
## Solution for me to experiment and test various kinds of neural networks and cool fractals

This project contains various different kinds of neural networks and datasets. Code is written more or less from scratch, from the matrix class to dot prod.
Some of the datasets / fractals included are

* MNIST
* Mandlebrot

With future plans for datasets being
* fMNIST
* Barnsley ferns
* N-body simulation data

Datasets are currently stored in just a .cpp file that can be included into new projects pretty easily.
There are many different iterations of neural networks in the solution, which are located in the following projects
* NeuralNetwork
* NeuralNetwork_2
* SingleBlockNeuralNetwork
* SingleBlockCudaNetwork
