## Solution for me to experiment and test various kinds of neural networks and cool fractals

This project contains various different kinds of neural networks and datasets. Code is written more or less from scratch, from the matrix class to dot prod.
Some of the datasets / fractals included are
* MNIST
* Mandlebrot

With future plans for FMINST, Barnsley ferns and perhaps n-body simulation datasets as well
